I was telling the brown girl about how I met both of you guys at two different locations. I was rolling in bed waiting for Natalie to come out but she never did.</td>

There was a big dog outside that wanted to come inside but there was some rule that they weren't allowed to come inside, but it was strange because there was a smaller dog inside??? Then another portion of the dream was being at the airport and waiting for a flight to somewhere. Olya came up and told me she had plans to go back to school. She was talking to me with crack-head energy which was very strange.</td>
